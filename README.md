A place for people to collaborate and rate episodes of Armstrong and Getty.

###Features:
**Calendar View** - Monthly view with episode summaries

**Episode Listing** - This page currently takes some time to load because I haven't implemented paging. So it's listing every episode)

**Searching** - This is huge for me - I can search for the word "ticket" and easily find the episode where Jack got a ticket and the "fight it" girl called in.

**Day View** - View a single day. Defaults to current day, but has paging page through days.

###Some ideas:
* User Registration
* Commenting
* Episode Rating
* Episode Tagging
