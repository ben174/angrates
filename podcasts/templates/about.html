            <p>I've been a huge <b>f</b>an of <b>A</b>rmstrong and <b>G</b>etty
                for <b>o</b>ver <b>f</b>ifteen <b>y</b>ears. I <i>love</i> that they
                give their podcast away. I quite simply couldn't listen if there wasn't
                a feed. I'm busy doing my day job when they broadcast. And my commute
                time doesn't sync up. And most importantly, the podcast allows me
                to listen to every minute of every show. Even if I get a few weeks
                behind, I always manage to catch up.</p>

            <p>This is <a href="http://www.armstrongandgettybingo.com">armstrongandgettybingo.com</a>.
                It is a site I created to make it easier to navigate their podcast
                feeds. It's also become the home of the <a href="/clips">clip gallery</a>
                and I have some other fun stuff planned for the future.</p>

            <p>TODO:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search</li>
                <li>User comments</li>

            <p>If you like this site enough to want to help with hosting costs, donations are appreciated
            (but not at all required)</p>
